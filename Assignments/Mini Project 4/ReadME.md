## Mini Project #4 : File Systems
\
### Problem.
You are now an expert on file systems. You decided to do some experiments with contiguous allocation and bit maps. The goal will be to find out how many holes you will need to skip before finding space to store a file requiring four blocks of storage. In order to run such experiment, you will need a bitmap of 32 bits (a typical integer number). To initialize the bitmap, you will randomly choose a number in the range 70,000 to 2,000,000. Keep in mind that Intel processors use little endian format, so most of the zeros will be on the right side of the stored number, for example, 70,000 (1117016) is stored as 0111 0000 0001 0001 0000 0001 0000 0000. In this example, the first hole has space for a single block, so it must be skipped. The second hole has 7 free blocks and could be used to store a four block file. You will run 10 experiments and calculate the average of skipped holes. For each experiment, record the random value used and the number of holes skipped. You will hand in the printout of your source code and the output value on the due date (no late work will be accepted). You can use Visual Studio, Cygwin or any other system you may have access to but the programming language must be C or C++. You can work in a group of at most 3 students.\
Again, be very careful with the bit sequence in a integer variable. Test your program with a known number before using the random values.
